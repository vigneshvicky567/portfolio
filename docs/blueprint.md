## Core Features:

- Interactive Resume: Transforms a static resume into an interactive, scroll-driven experience.
- Skill Dashboard Transition: Creates an animated transition as the user scrolls past the 'Get in Touch' section, clearing the skill grid to reveal a solid background.
- Loading Bar Animation: Implements a loading bar animation that fills in response to the user's scrolling speed, complete with bouncing initials and doodle icons.
- Hero Section Tag Display: Animates technology tags to 'pop' into existence around the developer's avatar, using a parallax effect.
- About Section Highlighting: Applies a scroll-triggered highlighter effect to the 'ABOUT' section, emphasizing keywords as the user scrolls.
- Journey Map Animation: Renders an interactive 3D map that tilts and rotates based on scroll position, synchronized with a pirate avatar traveling a career path timeline.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright yellow (#FFDA63) for a vibrant and energetic feel, inspired by the yellow background of the sample website.
- Background color: Pale yellow (#FAF7E8), a desaturated version of the primary color to create a cohesive base.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFC47A) for highlights and interactive elements, analogous to the primary and providing contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif for headlines and short amounts of body text; if longer text is anticipated, use 'Inter' for body.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets, mimicking the coding-style typography mentioned in the user prompt.
- Use hand-drawn icons to give a playful feel, in line with the sketch-themed website.
